# Classification and Prediction Tasks on FIFA 18 Player Data
## Abstract
This project explores the uses of data mining techniques to derive useful non-trivial information from a dataset of FIFA-registered professional soccer players. Two principal tasks are explored: (1) the classification of players by their position and (2) the prediction of each player’s market value. 

For the classification tasks, four classification techniques were utilized: Decision Trees, Random Forest Classification, Naïve Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors. All techniques were run using Python 3.8.6. The algorithms were evaluated mainly using the accuracy metric. Clustering techniques are employed in an experiment to see if they have any meaningful impact on performance results. 

For the prediction tasks, multiple linear regression is employed and is evaluated by the Root Mean Square Error (RSME) and R2 - score metrics. The goal of this project is to be able to derive insight into whether the players are (a) played in the correct position and (b) if they are overvalued or undervalued in the transfer market.
